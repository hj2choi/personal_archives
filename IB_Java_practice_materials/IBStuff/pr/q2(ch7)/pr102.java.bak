/*
Write a program that will read in a sequence of 0’s and 1’s as a binary number and change
the input form from binary to decimal. Remember that what is being read in are characters
and not numbers. Your program must test if only 0's and 1's are in the input. Otherwise
output error message. To test if the digit is a ‘0’ or a ‘1’ you must do the following
