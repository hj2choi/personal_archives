SERIES OF KNOWN ISSUES




////////////Resize function
*Works properly on contraction										// SOLVED
*When expanded, it doesn't initialize with background color		// SOLVED


////////////UNDO AND REDO
- Deleting and re-initializing undo and redo causes segmentation fault. And possible memory leak if it keeps going on.  // SOLVED
- Draw something => clear => redo leads to segmentation fault.    // SOLVED
- 
- Minor issue: Rarely causes segmentation fault at program termination, usually when maximum undo level is set to 0.



/////////// Custom Dialogues
- Connect funtion is prone to potential compile errors. "this" parameter is missing! (signal, this, slot)!!! Needs review on connect()
