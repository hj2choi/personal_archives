/*
Write a function gcd which calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b.
It does this by subtracting the smaller number from the larger and continues to do this until
the numbers are the same. e.g. start {36, 27} then next stage {9,27} then {9,18} then {9.9}
now stops because both numbers are the same. 9 is the gcd of 36 and 27
